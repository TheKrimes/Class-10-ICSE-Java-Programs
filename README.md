# Welcome to Class 10 ICSE Reposiratory!

This rep is created by Krimes who is me writing this info page. I only created this so that you guys who are reading this can do their icse projects in java by copy pasting the codes or find answers if you want. I am doing this to learn github and helping you to save your time in icse computer project which consists of 20 programs approx.

If you like this rep then follow me for my upcoming projects as i am learning java then i will learn python ig but maybe shift into backend devloping by learning js and use node.js as i like to work in minecraft servers. 

See ya!
